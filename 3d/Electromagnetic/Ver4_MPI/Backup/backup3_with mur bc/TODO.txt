###########3D EM PIC CODE#############

TO-DO LIST:


Radiation boundary:

1) Unpack the super cryptic 1d array boundary upadates and do them with nested do loops in all 3
dimensions

MPI:

1) Add particle exchange with "corner" ranks for 2d domain decomposition
2) Reuse bparticle_x,y,z, arrays as the particle buffers. 
   Use non blocking barrier and for particle excnahnge (see 'Using Advanced MPI' pg. 27)
3) Add separate field buffer arrays for each boundary. 
   Use non-blocking collectives (igather, iscatter) for field data 'halo' exchange (see 'Using Advanced
   Mpi' pg. 19)
